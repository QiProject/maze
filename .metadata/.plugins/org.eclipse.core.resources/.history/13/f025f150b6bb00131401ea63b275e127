...a large square room with a hole rudely broken through one wall. It must have taken a great deal of strength to pull the heavy stones out of position.<br>
<br>
The symmetry was also disturbed by the apparent loss of one of the room's statues. My visitors thought a thief had broken into the room, removed the figure, and made away with it. This, of course, was one explanation.<br>
<br>
"Another one!" they cried.<br>
<br>
"You mean another representative of the animal kingdom?" I asked.<br>
<br>
"What is a bird like that doing here?"<br>
<br>
"Roosting, evidently." Their attitude was really beginning to irritate me. I have come to think of all the inhabitants of this House as members of my little kingdom. People can be so arrogant...in a very real way we are all of us animals, at least in part.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't answer any more of their questions so we left this room to enter...<br>
