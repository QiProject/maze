...a large square room with a hole rudely broken through one wall.

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It must have taken a great deal of strength to pull the heavy stones out of position.
The symmetry was also disturbed by the apparent loss of one of the room's statues.

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
My visitors thought a thief had broken into the room, removed the figure, and made away with it. This, of course, was one explanation.

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
"Another one!" they cried.
"You mean another representative of the animal kingdom?" I asked.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
"What is a bird like that doing here?"
"Roosting, evidently." Their attitude was really beginning to irritate me.

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 I have come to think of all the inhabitants of this House as members of my little kingdom. People can be so arrogant...in a very real way we are all of us animals, at least in part.

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I wouldn't answer any more of their questions so we left this room to enter...
