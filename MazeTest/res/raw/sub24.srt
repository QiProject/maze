00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
...a place of unlimited darkness.

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
"Where are the doors?" they asked nervously. "We can't see any doors..."

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
"Be careful where you step!" said a cold voice. "This spot is taken." Dozens of eyes blinked at us in the Stygian gloom.

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
"There are no doors," said the voice. "You are here with the rest of us now..."

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Even my bellowing laughter couldn't fill this space.

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
